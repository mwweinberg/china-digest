This is a port of the china-daily-email project (https://github.com/mwweinberg/china-daily-email) because that repo is full of all sorts of random bits of stuff I used to figure out how to build it and therefore has become hard to follow.

china-daily-email.py is the primary script. 

input.csv is the input file to run the script.  It requires that each URL be paired with the appropriate letter code for the category of story associated with the URL.

template_first_half.html is the first part of the email template from mailchimp.

template_second_half.html is the second part of the email template from mailchimp.
